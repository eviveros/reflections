When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When I'm working with a team and we want to share our code so we can work in the same code with no interference

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Pulling changes manually I have the control about what's going on with the project. In the other way, it's quite
    possible to have so many unnecessary commits that make noise rather than help.
