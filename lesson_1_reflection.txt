How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    if in the older version was working then in the differences with the new version there must be the error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    if I need to go back to a specific version with an specific characteristic I have all the previous versions =)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    one of the pro's is you have total control about the commits and how versioning is making things. In the other hand, it's a time consuming task... and don't even forget to make a commit!!!

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I guess because, in this way, all the files have the same version number, and if we are speaking of software development, there are a bunches of files to work with just for one project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log lists all the history changes registered in the repository, and with git diff you can see what are the differences between versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I something went wrong I can go back to the original version where there was all good

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I used SVN and source safe but it seems Git is a good tool to have in the repertory
