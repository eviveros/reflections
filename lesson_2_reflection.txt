What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    it's created a special directory with all the medatada Git needs, the special directory is named .git
    We need to initialize Git so we have a starting point in the versioning with Git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    It's an interim area between the repository and the working directory, all the files you put in this area are ready
    to commit
    It's a last chance to repentance, it's a good feature because this way you can be sure what are you doing
